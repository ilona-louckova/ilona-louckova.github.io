  - Creating a blog with NetworkChuck and Hugo

Following a tutorial video from NetworkChuck: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnE7c0ELEH8

'We only know what we make'

- **Obsidian:** 
	- he got multiple colored headlines - I NEED THAT
- **Hugo:** 
	- tool to convert .md into website code
	- prereqs: Git (for GitHub code repo), Golang (from Google)
		- check install with git version, go version

**Battle Plan!**
1. Using Obsidian for taking notes - simply "type out the blog"
2. Turn it into HTML code, aka "make it code" using a tool called **Hugo**
3. Ship the code off/push site to GitHub
4. Web hook configured to send a notification to Hostinger, 
   telling it to pull down the latest version of our website and host it there.

- Install **everything**: Obsidian, Windows Terminal, Visual Studio Code, WSL 2, Golang, Python, Git and Hugo (add the .exe into your own program location - like Program Files - and also in Windows into PATH)
  a few days/weeks/months later...)
- Create a folder within your Obsidian Workspace for your blog posts
- Within this folder, start a new note (that will be your first blog post when you finish going through this article)
- Double-check correct installations via the `version` flagged commands:
  `go version`
  `git version`
  `hugo version`
  ...
- Navigate to your desired directory for storing blog files on your machine, e.g.: 
  `cd C:\Users\You\Documents\`
- Create a new Hugo folder with command below, effectively naming it after your blog:
  `hugo new site AwesomeStuff`
- `cd .\AwesomeStuff`
- `git init`
- `git config --global user.name "NAME"`
- `git config --global user.email "name@wherever.com"`
- Navigate to [Hugo Themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/) website and pick a theme you would like to install for your blog
- Select option "Install theme as a submodule", e.g. for [Terminal theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-terminal/) it looks like this:
  `git submodule add -f https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal.git themes/terminal`
- Configuration file is called `hugo.toml` and it needs to match the theme
- Terminal theme has a text file at the bottom of the page which you can copy it from (leave out module and module.imports at the bottom) and paste into your `hugo.toml`
- Via CLI, you can open it with programs `notepad hugo.toml` like Chuck, or `npp hugo.toml` like myself (that's also custom though), on Linux use nano etc. 
- Next, run your Hugo server preview with `hugo server -t terminal`
- Take a look at `//localhost:1313/`
- Ctrl+C to cancel preview
